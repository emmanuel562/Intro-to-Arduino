# Intro-to-Arduino
This repository contains my practice exercises from learning Arduino programming.
I followed Paul McWhorter’s “Arduino Tutorial Series” on YouTube and used the lessons to gain an understanding of the basics of microcontrollers, electronics, and C++ programming.

What’s Inside
1. Basic digital I/O (LEDs, buttons, buzzers)
2. Analog input with sensors and potentiometers
3. Serial communication
4. Simple projects recreated from the tutorials
5. Programming concepts, e.g, Loops, control flow, functions.

Tools Used
1. Wokwi Simulator 

Why I’m Doing This
I’m building a strong foundation in Arduino so I can apply it to mechatronics, embedded systems, and robotics.
This repo tracks my personal progress and small experiments as I learn.
