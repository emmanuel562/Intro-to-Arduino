# 🤖 Intro-to-Arduino
This repository contains my practice exercises from learning Arduino programming.
I followed Paul McWhorter’s “Arduino Tutorial Series” on YouTube and used the lessons to gain an understanding of the basics of microcontrollers, electronics, and C++ programming.

What’s Inside
1. Basic digital I/O (LEDs, buttons, buzzers)
2. Analog input with sensors and potentiometers
3. Serial communication
4. Simple projects recreated from the tutorials
5. Programming concepts, e.g, Loops, control flow, functions.

Tools Used
1. Wokwi Simulator - https://www.wokwi.com

Why I’m Doing This
I’m building a strong foundation in Arduino so I can apply it to mechatronics, embedded systems, and robotics.
This repo tracks my personal progress and small experiments as I learn.
